<h1><a name="_Toc95395316">Program Installation</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">To install Chainmaille Designer, simply
download and run the ChainmailleDesigner.exe.&nbsp; This is a
self-extracting installer, which unpacks the 260-odd files (mostly
files that define the various weaves) then runs the setup program
which copies these files to the right places on your computer.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc95395317">What to Expect</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The first thing you’ll see is the Windows
prompt asking if you want to allow this app from an unknown
publisher (that’s me!) to make changes on your system.&nbsp; After
you say Yes to that, you’ll see another little window asking if you
want to install Chainmaille Designer; say Yes to that too.&nbsp;
You’ll see a progress bar as the installer unpacks itself, and when
the unpacking is done you’ll see a “Preparing to Install” window
with another progress bar.&nbsp; Before too long, it is replaced
with a window that actually shows some chainmaille.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Welcome window identifies the program and
lets you know that you are about to install it.&nbsp; Clicking on
the Next button gets you to the license agreement.&nbsp; As of
version 3.0, Chainmaille Designer is licensed under the standard
GNU General Public License, version 3, which is a standard license
for free software.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you accept the terms (by clicking on “I
accept…”), the Next button gets you to a window where you can
change where it is installed on your system.&nbsp; Most people will
be happiest by just clicking Next.&nbsp; This gets you to a final
confirmation window “Ready to Install…”.&nbsp; For what it’s worth,
this is your last chance to cancel the installation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clicking the Install button starts copying the
files to where they need to go.&nbsp; There is a progress window,
but it goes by quickly and is replaced by the “Completed”
window.&nbsp; A check box in the middle of this window allows you
to start running the Chainmaille Designer immediately; if you don’t
want that, uncheck the box before clicking on the Finish
button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Assuming you decided to run the program,
you’ll see the two windows of Chainmaille Designer itself: &nbsp;a
narrow palette window and a larger design window.&nbsp; If you’re
anxious to get started, especially if you have previously worked
with the Irregular Grid Painter (IGP), you’re welcome to skip right
to “Get Me Started!!”, possibly after a side trip to “IGP and
Chainmaille Designer”.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, you prefer a
more leisurely introduction or just appreciate a more organized
presentation that starts from first principles and works its way up
to the full range of capabilities of the software, read on.</p>
