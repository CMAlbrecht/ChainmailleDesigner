<h1><a name="_Toc98949845">IGP and Chainmaille Designer</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">Even though I view Chainmaille Designer as a
successor to Zlosk’s IGP, this shouldn’t be interpreted too
literally. IGP was written in Visual Basic, on a very early version
of Microsoft’s .NET framework.&nbsp; Chainmaille Designer is
written in C#.&nbsp; Those of you who have a programming background
will already have inferred what I am about to state
explicitly:&nbsp; not one speck of the IGP source code could be
reused in Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What I did instead was to re-use the
<i>concepts</i> of IGP and produce entirely new implementations of
IGP <i>functionality</i>, then I went further, providing new
concepts and new functionality (guided both by Zlosk’s published
list of features he would like to have implemented and by those
aspects of using IGP that I found most frustrating).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this context, it is worthy of mention that
a web version of the original IGP has been developed by Andrew
Ganim in Javascript.&nbsp; The web IGP is available through Lost
Senses Designs (<a href=
"http://www.lostsensesdesigns.ca/cigp">http://www.lostsensesdesigns.ca/cigp</a>).&nbsp;
While I don’t agree with Andrew’s published assertion that the best
thing about IGP is that it “<span class="postbody">doesn't
specifically care about building chainmail</span>” (and have gone
to great lengths to make Chainmaille Designer specifically
<i>more</i> useful for actually building chainmaille), his work has
done everyone the service of making IGP accessible to users of UNIX
and Macs and, presumably, mobile phones.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949846">Important Differences between IGP and
Chainmaille Designer</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">A design is more than just an ordered
collection of colors.&nbsp; Using IGP, the only way in which your
design could be saved was as a simple sequence of colors in image
file format.&nbsp; It didn’t even remember which weave you were
using for that design.&nbsp; The design files of Chainmaille
Designer maintain your weave selection, the sizes of rings you
decided to use, whether the design wraps from edge to edge, and
will even keep track of when and for whom the design was
created.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Colors are important in inlay work!&nbsp;
Unless you are anodizing or enameling your rings yourself, there is
a limited number of colors available with which to execute your
design, and they are NOT Windows-standard red, green, blue,
etc.&nbsp; Also, the best way to specify colors is NOT as
red-green-blue triples, and certainly not with the standard Windows
color picker.&nbsp; Chainmaille Designer lets you save collections
of colors as palettes and retrieve them for use in your designs,
and it provides a color picker that not only has a clue about
colors but allows you to sample your colors from pictures of rings
provided by your supplier.&nbsp; IGP didn’t even remember what
colors you were using from one session to the next.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Printing is a thing.&nbsp; Not very many
people have their computer open in front of them as they build
something out of chainmaille.&nbsp; (For one thing, it just doesn’t
look good at SCA events.)&nbsp; IGP made you save the rendered
image of your design to an image file, then use some <i>other
program</i> to open and print the image file (and the same thing
for the color report, but it had to be a <i>different</i> other
program because, text).&nbsp; Chainmaille Designer lets you print
directly from the Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Real designs have edges and corners.&nbsp;
Pretending that designs take place in an infinite sheet might have
been a good first approximation for what was, essentially, a class
project, but (as the DEDragonscale and DE-Euro4in1 weaves
distributed with this program show) it’s possible to do much
better, enhancing the ability to visualize what the design will
actually look like when it is executed by accurately representing
the interactions of the rings at the edges and corners.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Did we say “infinite sheet”?&nbsp; Ah, but it
wasn’t infinite, was it?&nbsp; Ever tried to change the size of
your IGP design?&nbsp; It couldn’t actually be done in IGP.&nbsp;
Instead you had to open up the color image in an imaging program
(there’s that <i>other program</i> again) to add just the right
number of pixels to the edges, which, by the way, required knowing
how your chosen weave used the color image, which you could only
know by reading and actually understanding the .ini file that
defined the weave.&nbsp; Because Chainmaille Designer treats your
design <i>as a design</i> instead of a bunch of pixels it’s very
easy to add or subtract chainmaille units from any of the edges of
your design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Then there’s zoom.&nbsp; When IGP came out it
showed the designs in more-or-less actual size (that old 72 pixels
per inch standard; remember that? No? &nbsp;Well <i>I’m</i> old
enough to).&nbsp; As monitors acquired higher and higher
resolutions, those IGP graphics got smaller and smaller on the
screen, and it got harder and harder to paint the rings you were
trying to paint.&nbsp; There were also issues at the other end of
the scale:&nbsp; have you ever designed a chainmaille dress in
3/16-inch rings using IGP?&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; Trouble was, I could
never see the whole thing because IGP didn’t let me zoom out.&nbsp;
Chainmaille Designer fixes those issues for the designer by
allowing zoom from 1% to 10,000%, with a special button to quickly
return to 100% and another one to fit the entire design within the
design area.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc98949848">Functionality New to Chainmaille
Designer</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nearly as briefly, these are the capabilities
I added to Chainmaille Designer above and beyond what was available
in IGP.&nbsp; With Chainmaille Designer, you can:</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949849">Zoom</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Zoom in or out
without using more memory.</span></p>

</ul>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949850">New Designs and Design Editing</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Define the
components of a chainmaille design and design an XML file format
capable of representing the design information.&nbsp; Allow designs
to be saved and read in this format.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow design name
and weave to be specified when creating a new design.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a form
that shows information about the design:</span></p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal" style='line-height:normal'>Name of the
design</li>
<li class="MsoNormal" style='line-height:normal'>Weave name</li>

<li class="MsoNormal" style='line-height:normal'>Other descriptive
information (design notes, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Change the size
of an existing design, adding units or distance to any combination
of edges.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Use actual
chainmaille units in size specifications (not pixels in the color
map), i.e. rows and columns of units.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Use distance
measurements in size specifications (at least inches and
centimeters).&nbsp; This maps back to ring size, obviously, so
depends on the size of rings in which a pattern will be
woven.</span></p>

the user drill down through many layers of menus to choose a weave
as IGP did, find all weaves in the configured weave directory and
present them in list form for selection.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>As an alternative
to the list, provide a gallery that presents images of the weaves
along with their names. &nbsp;Allow the user to select a weave by
double-clicking on its image.</span></p>

indexed-color color image, convert it into a 32bppARGB
bitmap.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide the
ability to specify rings as not there (making them transparent) for
diagonal edges, triangular panels, etc.&nbsp; Transparent rings are
not counted by the color counter.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow a design to
be rotated, so that weaves available in one orientation can be
presented in another, and to better fit the available screen
dimensions.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a way to
specify guidelines for the design to aid in layout.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>For weaves of
more than one size of ring, allow painting operations to be
restricted to rings of only one of those sizes.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a way to
paint shapes, i.e. to draw straight lines and to paint either
hollow or filled circles, ellipses, rectangles, or polygons to
rough in large swatches of color.</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949851">Printing</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Print the
rendered image to fit the printer page, directly to a
printer.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Print the color
count report, including row length encodings for each row of the
design, directly to a printer.</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949852">Colors, Palette, and Palette
Editor</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Be able to create
named collections (palettes) of colors to use in the designer, e.g.
the ring colors available for anodized aluminum rings purchased
from The Ring Lord.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Be able to define
palette sections, e.g. Anodized Aluminum ring colors vs. EPDM
(Rubber) ring colors.&nbsp; Each section can be assigned a name and
an abbreviated name (the abbreviated name is used, if needed, to
distinguish between colors from different palette sections that
have the same color name in the color report.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Define a palette
XML file format to save color choices.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Read in palette
information from a palette file, prompting to save if the current
palette has been changed.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Devise a palette
control to use while painting rings that not only shows the current
selected colors, but allows selection of any color in the palette.
&nbsp;Show the sections, if any.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>In the palette
control, allow sections to be collapsed (when they aren’t needed)
or expanded (if they are).</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Tool tips for
palette color patches display the name of the color.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a nifty
tool for color selection.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Be able to define
each color either as HSL or as RGB.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow each color
to be named, e.g. royal blue, sky blue, seafoam green.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow a color to
be sampled and averaged from a region of a source image.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a way to
replace one color in a design with another color, either from the
current palette or specified either as HSL or RGB.&nbsp; For weaves
that use more than one ring size, allow color replacement to affect
only one ring size, if desired.&nbsp; This allows all of those old
IGP designs done in Windows-standard red, green, etc. to be easily
recast in colors drawn from the appropriate palette.&nbsp; It also
makes it absurdly easy to change, say, a fire-themed design into a
water-themed design.</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949853">Color Counting</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>In the color
count window, show patches of each color next to the color
name.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>In the color
count report, substitute the names of colors in the palette for the
RGB triples that IGP showed.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>In the color
count report, substitute system color names (e.g. Alice Blue) for
colors that are not named in the palette but for which system
colors are predefined.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Make relationship
between visual rows and columns and as-built rows and columns more
explicit. &nbsp;When preparing the color report, use as-built rows
instead of visual rows, if build information is available, so that
the report is more useful as build instructions.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>In the color
report, distinguish between colors from different palette sections
that have the same color name, by showing and using the section
abbreviated name (e.g. "Anodized Alum. (Al)" ... "EPDM (Rubber)
(Rub)", then, when needed in the row portion of the report,
appending the section abbreviated name to the color name (e.g.
"green(Al): 7").</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949854">Inlay Overlays</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow an image to
be imported to use as a semi-transparent overlay to the ring
pattern, as a guide to coloring the rings.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Allow an imported
overlay image to be moved, rotated, and squeezed or stretched to
cover the design area.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide control
over the transparency of an overlay.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Automatically use
the colors of an overlay image to color the rings of the design,
matching the ring colors to the colors available in the
palette.</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949855">Weave Specification</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Define an XML
format for weave pattern files that allows edge and corner images,
chain vs. sheet linkage, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Edge graphics for
rectangular sheet edges.&nbsp; Corner graphics for
corners.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Option to treat
edges to wrap around (e.g. for a bracelet), either horizontally or
vertically.</span></p>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Make relationship
between chainmaille units and visual rows and columns more
explicit.&nbsp; Edges will need to have their own numbers of rows
and columns, separate from the main sheet.&nbsp; Use this
information when design size is specified.</span></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949856">Other Features</a></h3>
<p><span style='font-family:"Book Antiqua",serif'>Provide a
configuration form for setting the default directories for weave
patterns, image files, designs, palettes, etc.</span></p>
