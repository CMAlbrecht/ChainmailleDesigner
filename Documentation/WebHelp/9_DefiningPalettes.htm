<h1><a name="_Toc95395402">Defining Palettes</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you wish, you can define your own
palettes.&nbsp; There are a couple of reasons why this is a good
capability to have.&nbsp; For one, your ring supplier (if you don’t
make your own rings) may not be The Ring Lord, so defining a
palette of the colors available from your supplier makes excellent
sense.&nbsp; Colors can also vary from batch to batch, so editing
your palette allows you to adjust the colors used for a particular
project to be closer to what you have on hand.&nbsp; Finally, new
colors are introduced from time to time (some only temporarily),
and colors are occasionally discontinued, so it’s good to be able
to adapt your palette as availability changes.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc95395403">Editing a Palette</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin editing an open palette, select
Palette &gt; Edit from the menu of the palette window itself (not
the main design window).&nbsp; If, instead, you wish to create a
new palette, begin by selecting Palette &gt; New from the same
menu.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Either way, the Edit Palette window will
appear.&nbsp; The top section of this window lets you name your
palette and provide a description.&nbsp; The bottom section of the
window is where the palette sections are defined.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="576" height="380" id="Picture 27"

alt="image" name="Picture 27"></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc95395404">Editing Palette Sections</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Palette sections are mostly for holding a
collection of colors, but sections should also be named and given a
2- or 3-letter abbreviation.&nbsp; The section name is displayed in
the palette window when you are using the palette (as you’ve
already seen).&nbsp; The abbreviation is used in the row-by-row
section of detailed color count reports when two colors with the
same name (say, “green”) from different sections must be
distinguished.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each palette section is shown in its own
tab.&nbsp; To select a palette section for editing, click on its
name in the row of tabs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The last tab, the one with the plus sign (+),
is special.&nbsp; Clicking on this tab creates a whole new palette
section, which can then be named and have colors added to it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To delete a palette section, select it for
editing, then click on the little square button just to the left of
the words “Section Name”.&nbsp; A palette must have at least one
section, so you will not be able to delete a section if it is the
only section in the palette.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc95395405">Editing Palette Colors</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To add a color to the selected palette
section, click on the Add Color button in the upper right corner of
the palette section tab.&nbsp; This causes the Choose a Color
window to appear (see Choose a Color, below, for how to use this
window).&nbsp; Once a color has been chosen, it is added to the tab
area of the selected palette section and can then be named.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each color of a palette section has a small,
square delete button, a larger color patch that shows the actual
color, and a text field for entering the name of the color.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="129" height="36" id="Picture 28"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image070.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 28"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To delete a color from the selected palette
section, click on the little square button just to the left of the
color patch for the color you wish to delete.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I recommend that you enter a name for each
color defined.&nbsp; Color names are useful, especially if you buy
your rings from a supplier (in which case, they should be the name
that the supplier gives the color to help you when you order
rings).&nbsp; They are used in the color report (which can tell you
how many rings of each color you need for your design) and they
also appear as “hint text” when you hover over a color patch in the
palette window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To set or change a color in the selected
palette section, click on the color patch that shows the
color.&nbsp; When you do this, the Choose a Color window appears,
from which you can change the color you clicked on.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc95395406">Choose a Color</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Choose a Color window allows you to
specify a color in several different ways.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="445" height="242" id=
"Picture 122" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image071.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 122"><br>
Choose a Color window, invoked for the “seafoam” color.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are four main areas of the window.&nbsp;
On the left is a tool which allows you to specify a color
graphically.&nbsp; The top middle area just shows the selected
color against a neutral gradient (from black, through grey, to
white) so you can get an idea of what it will look like against a
variety of backgrounds.&nbsp; Below that, the components of the
color are shown.&nbsp; On the right are the buttons.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc95395407">Using the Color Tool</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The color tool provides a graphic
representation of the hue, saturation, and luminance components of
the color.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The outer ring is the hue circle, showing the
entire range of available hues (these start with red on the right,
then cycle around through yellow, green, blue, and violet before
returning to red).&nbsp; On the outside of the ring is a tick mark
indicating which of the hues has been chosen.&nbsp; To choose a
hue, click either within or outside the ring.&nbsp; You can also
click and drag, but this can be a bit slow; it takes a while to
fill the triangle with the entire range of colors at a particular
hue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The triangle shows the range of colors
available at the selected hue.&nbsp; A white cursor in the triangle
shows the combination of saturation and luminance for the chosen
color.&nbsp; The most saturated colors are in the corner of the
triangle closest to the hue indicator.&nbsp; Moving away from full
saturation, colors become either more white or black (in the other
two corners) or more grey (on the side opposite the saturated
corner).&nbsp; To choose a combination of saturation and luminance
for the selected hue, click within the triangle.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc95395408">Specifying Color Components</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also specify the hue, saturation, and
luminance components of the color either numerically (in the boxes
labeled with H, S, and L, respectively) or by using the slider
controls to the right of the boxes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you must, you can also specify the color as
a combination of red, green, and blue components using the boxes or
sliders labeled R, G, and B.&nbsp; While this way of specifying
colors is incorrect for colors that arise from reflectance (as ring
colors do), a surprising number of people, ignorant of the nature
of color, can only think of colors in this way.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc95395409">Sampling a Color from an Image</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">As an alternative to trying to match a ring
color either graphically or numerically, you can sample the color
from a picture of the rings.&nbsp; While pictures are not always
faithful representations of colors, picking a color from an image
can be very convenient, so I have tried to make it easy to do.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To sample a color from an image, begin by
clicking on the Sample button in the lower right corner of the
Choose a Color window.&nbsp; This brings up a file selector with
which you can select the image that contains the color you
want.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="320" id="Picture 64"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image072.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 64"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Selecting the image file, then clicking the
Open button, shows the selected image in the sampling window.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="380" height="285" id="Picture 65"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image073.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 65"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In this window, you can use the mouse wheel to
zoom in and out and use the scroll bars to show the portion of the
image you wish to sample from.&nbsp; When you’re ready, use the
mouse to take a color sample from the image.&nbsp; You can do this
in one of two ways.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
<b>Left</b> Button – Take a sample from a 5 x 5 pixel area of the
image and average the results by clicking on the desired sample
area with the left mouse button.&nbsp; This is useful for
good-resolution images like the one in our example, where you want
a color that represents the visual impression of what is really a
range of colors.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
<b>Right</b> Button – Take a sample from a single pixel of the
image by clicking on the desired sample area with the right mouse
button.&nbsp; This is useful for lower-resolution images where
using a 5 x 5 area runs the risk of including outline or background
pixels in the average.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you have taken your sample, you will be
presented with a confirmation window which displays the sampled
color.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="242" height="113" id="Picture 66"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image074.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 66"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the color doesn’t seem quite right, you can
click the No button, which will return you to your selected image,
from which you can take a different sample.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Otherwise, click the Yes button.&nbsp; This
will return you to the Choose a Color window with the color of your
color sample selected.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc95395410">When You Are Done with a Color</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">When a color is chosen to your satisfaction,
click the OK button of the Choose a Color window.&nbsp; The chosen
color replaces the color you selected to edit in its palette
section.</p>
