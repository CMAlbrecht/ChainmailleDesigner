<h1><a name="_Toc98949805">Overlays</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">An overlay in Chainmaille Designer is an
ordinary image that is displayed semi-transparently over your
design.&nbsp; It won’t color your rings for you, but if your
subject matter is already available in image form it can be a
useful guide to coloring rings.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949806">Overlay Images</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before you set up an overlay, you must have at
least the beginning of a design:&nbsp; a chosen weave and the
physical extent (width and height) are the bare minimum.&nbsp; When
choosing the size of your design, bear in mind that your rings are
your “pixels”.&nbsp; This does <b>not</b> mean that you should make
your design with as many rings as the original image has
pixels.&nbsp; Most images in this day and age have millions of
pixels, and I don’t know about you, but I don’t have enough life
left that I’m willing to expend it doing nothing but a single
chainmaille inlay.&nbsp; Instead consider how many “pixels” you’ll
need for the image to be recognizable and, if applicable, the due
date for finishing the work.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you have something in the design area,
open an overlay by choosing Design &gt; Overlay &gt; Open from the
menu and choose the image file from amongst the files on your
system.&nbsp; Once you’ve chosen the image, it will appear over
your design offset and scaled without distortion to its extent.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="625" height="351" id="Picture 52"

alt="image" name="Picture 52"><br>
An image overlay over European 4-1, 200 x 100 units.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To see the whole thing, click on the Fit
button in the lower right corner of the window.&nbsp; In the
example above, you can see that the proportions of the image don’t
match the proportions of the design.&nbsp; In this situation, there
are a few basic choices:&nbsp; 1) do nothing; the non-overlaid
portions of the design become borders (which can be made fancier if
you wish).&nbsp; 2) Ad lib, creating more design to fill the
non-overlaid portions of the design.&nbsp; 3) Distort the image
(stretching it, in this case) to cover the non-overlaid portions,
and 4) Change the size of the design to match the image (in this
case, removing units from the top and bottom edges).&nbsp; Changing
the size of the design is covered elsewhere, and creating more
design is a bit beyond the scope of this simple instruction manual,
but stretching, squashing, and repositioning the overlay are all
things you can easily do from within Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949807">Manipulating the Overlay Image</a></h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949808">Rotating the Overlay</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If your overlay image is sideways or
upside-down for your design, you can use the Design menu to rotate
the overlay to the correct orientation in quarter-turn steps.&nbsp;
Take care to use the rotation options “inside” the Overlay menu
choice; if you use the rotation options at the Design level, it
won’t be just the overlay that rotates.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rotation operations can be undone, and if you
undo too much, re-done (provided you don’t perform some other
operation between the undo and the redo).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949809">Stretching, Squashing, and Zooming the
Overlay</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin stretching or squashing the overlay,
hold down the control button of your keyboard, then press and hold
down either mouse button.&nbsp; As you move the mouse, the overlay
image will adjust; becoming larger as you move to the right and/or
downward from the point at which you started the operation, or
smaller as you move to the left and/or upward from that point.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Most images can be stretched or squashed a bit
without looking too absurd, but some can’t be (images of faces, for
example).&nbsp; If you want to make the overlay image larger or
smaller without distorting it, use the mouse wheel, as you would
for zooming in or out of your design, but while holding the shift
key down.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you’ve been doing this as you’re reading,
you’ve probably noticed it already, but rotation, zooming,
stretching, and squashing the overlay image all happen with respect
to the center of the overlay image; in other words, the center of
the overlay image stays in the same place, but the image rotates or
gets bigger or smaller around that point.&nbsp; Because the overlay
starts out centered in your design, that’s probably what you’ll
want most of the time.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="561" height="316" id="Picture 54"

The overlay image stretched to fit the design size.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949810">Panning the Overlay</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can, however, also adjust where the
overlay image is on your design, also called panning.&nbsp; You do
this by holding down the shift key while using the mouse to click
and drag.&nbsp; For example, if I particularly liked the flower on
the right side of my overlay image, I could use the shift-wheel
combination to zoom in to the right degree, then the shift-drag
combination to center the desired flower in my design area.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="560" height="315" id="Picture 55"

<h2><a name="_Toc98949811">Using the Overlay as a Guide to Painting
Rings</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, you may be thinking, “That’s very pretty,
but pasting an image over a drawing of rings isn’t actually a
design,” and you’d be absolutely right.&nbsp; To make it a design,
you’d want to assign ring colors from your palette to each of the
rings of your design.&nbsp; Except for the color-and-shape
judgement calls involved, this is a simple matter of painting the
rings in the usual fashion, but now you have the overlay to guide
you.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="560" height="315" id="Picture 56"

Overlaid design as painting progresses.&nbsp; This part of the
design is mostly gold, champagne, and white rings with a very few
green rings.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949812">The Overlay Control</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img width="88" height="1" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image054.png" align=
"right" hspace="12" alt="image">As you are painting with an
overlay, you may find it handy to periodically hide the overlay to
see the effect of your ring color assignments without the overlay
image on top.&nbsp; To do this, you can select Design &gt; Overlay
&gt; Hide from the menu.&nbsp; To bring a hidden overlay back,
select Design &gt; Overlay &gt; Show from the menu.&nbsp; There’s
also a keyboard shortcut for this: &nbsp;holding down the Alt key
while typing “o” will toggle the overlay on and off.&nbsp; Similar
functionality is provided by the checkbox in the Overlay control;
checking or unchecking the box will toggle the overlay on and
off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The slider in the Overlay control also allows
you to control the overlay opacity as you work, in case the default
50% is not to your taste.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949813">Coloring Rings from the Overlay</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chainmaille Designer provides a way to
jump-start your design by coloring all of the rings based upon the
overlay image.&nbsp; It does this by computing the average overlay
color within each ring outline, then matching the average color for
each ring to the closest color of the palette section of your
choice.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before you start, however, make sure you have
loaded a palette and positioned the overlay to your liking.&nbsp;
[Note:&nbsp; If, like me, you use different palette sections for
different ring sizes, you’ll have to do the coloring once for each
ring size.]</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="172" height="336" id="Picture 1"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image055.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 1"></p>
<p class="MsoCaption">Iris overlay on Dragonscale bracelet</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To color the rings in this way, select Colors
&gt; Color Rings from Overlay.&nbsp; This brings up a very
blank-looking form which stays blank while the designer completes
the rather arduous process of computing the average overlay color
for each ring.&nbsp; A small progress bar just below the Cancel
button shows how this computation is progressing.&nbsp; The more
pixels in the overlay image, the longer this part of the process
takes.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="626" height="384" id="Picture 3"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image056.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 3"></p>
<p class="MsoCaption">Preview of automatic ring coloring using the
Titanium palette section</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the pre-computation is complete, the
dialog is filled in.&nbsp; In the dialog, you can see a preview of
the result of coloring the rings from the overlay. You can change
which section of the palette is used to match the overlay colors,
and (if there are multiple ring sizes in your design) you can set
which rings will be colored from the overlay; rings which you do
not choose color from the overlay will retain their original
color.&nbsp; In each case, the preview will be updated to show the
result of your choices.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also affect the matching of colors to
the palette by changing the sliders in the Color Matching
section.&nbsp; These controls transform the colors pre-computed
from the overlay before matching them to the colors of the palette
section.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three sets of controls in the Color
Matching section:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style=
'margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style=
'font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
The L* controls affect luminance (overall brightness).&nbsp; Moving
either slider to the left makes the colors more black, while moving
either slider to the right makes the colors whiter.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style=
'margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style=
'font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
The a* controls affect the green-red component of the color.&nbsp;
Moving either slider to the left makes the colors greener, while
moving either slider to the right makes the colors more red.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=
'margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style=
'font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
The b* controls affect the blue-yellow component of the
color.&nbsp; Moving either slider to the left makes the colors more
blue, while moving either slider to the right makes the colors
yellower.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Each set of controls in the Color Matching
section consists of one checkbox and two sliders, one above the
other.&nbsp; The checkbox is easy to explain:&nbsp; with the
checkbox off, colors will be unaffected by the sliders in that set
of controls; with the checkbox on, the sliders in that set of
controls will affect the color matching process.&nbsp; As for the
sliders:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style=
'margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style=
'font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
The upper slider in each set changes the color offset, shifting all
of the colors in the image uniformly.&nbsp; For example, moving the
b* offset to the right makes all the colors the same amount
yellower before they are matched to the palette colors.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style=
'margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-.25in'><span style=
'font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
The lower slider in each set changes the color scale, accentuating
or de-emphasizing color differences within the image.&nbsp; For
example, moving the L* scale to the right does make all the colors
brighter, but rings that were already bright will become a lot
brighter, while darker colors will be much less affected.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you really mess things up moving the
sliders around, the easiest way to get back to “normal” is to
uncheck the three checkboxes.</p>
<h3><a name="node31" id="node31"></a>Technical Notes</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Green-red?&nbsp; Blue-yellow?&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These are the colors of the CIE L*a*b* color
space.&nbsp; We use the CIE L*a*b* color space for this operation
because it is the only color space for which the difference between
colors can be computed in any consistent and useful way, and we
can’t pick a “closest” color from a palette section without a
consistent and useful measure of the difference between two
colors.&nbsp; See the Wikipedia article on “Color Difference” if
you really want to dig into the details.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For those who really want to know, the offsets
run from -50 to 50 with zero in the middle and the scales run from
-0.5 to 2.5 with one in the middle.</p>
<h3><a name="node32" id="node32"></a>When You’re Done Changing
Things</h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you are satisfied with the coloration of
the preview, clicking the OK button will apply those color changes
to your design.&nbsp; At this point, I usually hide the overlay
temporarily so that I can just see the assigned ring colors.&nbsp;
If you’re really lucky, you’ll be happy with the result.&nbsp; Most
of the time, you will not be that lucky.&nbsp; I usually have to
perform color replacement (see <b><i>Replacing Colors in Your
Design,</i></b> below), followed up by individually painting rings
along critical edges and other fine tuning.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, here’s an image off of the
internet of St. Basil’s Cathedral, and the corresponding
automatically colored result.</p>
<p align="center" style='text-align:center'><img width="548"
height="309" id="Picture 58" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image057.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 58"></p>
<p align="center" style='text-align:center'><img width="542"
height="308" id="Picture 103" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image058.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 103"></p>
<p class="MsoCaption">St. Basil’s Cathedral, original image and
auto-colored chainmaille design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The auto-colored result is definitely
recognizable, definitely a good start, but it could still use some
work.&nbsp; Some changes I would want to make would be to better
define the stripes on the red and white dome in front (at least the
lower half), extend the colors of all of the other domes into the
shadows at their bases, and make the gold bits at the tops of the
domes more distinctively gold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the palette of the overlay image is
already limited, you should expect less immediately-recognizable
results.&nbsp; Here’s a picture of me and the auto-colored
result.</p>
<p align="center" style='text-align:center'><img width="182"
height="274" id="Picture 128" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image059.jpg" alt=
"image" name="Picture 128"><img width="183" height="275" id=
"Picture 129" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image060.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 129"><img width="156" height="240" id=
"Picture 130" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image061.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 130"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Not so attractive, eh?&nbsp; However, simply
replacing the non-black rings with all bronze or all champagne
actually improves it.&nbsp; I have often found that having started
from a limited-palette original, the way to a better design will be
to further limit the palette.</p>
<p align="center" style='text-align:center'><img width="182"
height="275" id="Picture 131" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image062.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 131"><img width="156" height="176" id=
"Picture 132" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image063.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 132"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’d still want to clean up the edges a bit
manually, but to get to this point I have spent maybe five minutes
and nearly all of the rings have been colored the way I would want
them to be.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949814">The Overlay Image in the Design
File</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you save your design, the overlay image
file name is saved with the design in the design file, along with
the position of the overlay from the corner of your design, the
scaling you applied to the overlay (zooming, stretching and
squashing), and its rotation (if any).&nbsp; The design file also
records whether the overlay was showing when the file was saved and
the overlay opacity setting.&nbsp; When you later open your design
again, Chainmaille Designer looks for the overlay image file, then
applies it over your design so that you can pick up right where you
left off.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, this won’t work if you move or
delete the overlay image before trying to open your design again,
so before applying an image as an overlay I recommend copying it to
the design directory so that it will always be with the
design.&nbsp; If it can’t find the overlay that goes with your
design, Chainmaille Designer will ask you where the overlay image
is, but it’s better to avoid trouble than to fix it.</p>
