<h1><a name="_Toc98949739">Chainmaille Designer Concepts</a></h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949740">Design Concepts</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">An inlay design has several conceptual
components.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949741">Subject Matter</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The subject matter is the actual graphic image
or theme that is intended to be depicted in the final work.&nbsp;
This part, of course, is entirely up to you (although it’s best to
avoid copyright violations).&nbsp; You can start with a photograph,
painting, sketch, or even just a general idea of the kind of thing
you want to depict.&nbsp; I once opened up a design with no more of
an idea than “water; I want it to give the impression of
water”.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have a specific image in mind, though,
Chainmaille Designer lets you bring in that image as an overlay to
your design which can be moved around, scaled, stretched, and
squashed to fit the extent of your design, then used as a guide to
assigning colors to the rings.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949742">Weave</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The construction pattern used to connect the
rings into a sheet is called the weave, although in this program
(and in its predecessor, IGP) the weave is also called the
pattern.&nbsp; When you start a design in Chainmaille Designer
you’ll have the opportunity to select a pattern file which
establishes the weave for your design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you’re just starting out and don’t know
what weave to choose, I recommend beginning with the European
four-in-one weave; it’s straightforward and easy.&nbsp; On the
other hand, if one of the other weaves available from within the
program captures your imagination, run with it!&nbsp; When you
build your design, you’ll be investing many hours into the process,
so it makes sense to choose a weave that you like the look of.</p>

<p class="MsoCaption">A few weaves (and some scales) from the
collection.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you’re ready, I encourage you to go
beyond the program by exploring sites like the Maille Artisans
International League.&nbsp; There are many hundreds of ways of
weaving rings into sheets, at least a dozen of which lend
themselves very nicely to inlay work.&nbsp; If you find one you
really like, you can write the pattern file for it and make it
available to the rest of us!</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949743">Topology</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The topology of a design (indicated in the
program as the <i>wrap</i>) specifies the way in which the edges of
the design connect, if they connect.&nbsp; A design that is
equivalent to a flat sheet (a banner or tabletop cover, for
example) does not wrap; in the program it has a wrap of
“none”.&nbsp; Similarly, a design that represents a band, such as a
collar or bracelet, which will be closed by a clasp has a wrap of
“none” because even where the band will be joined by the clasp, the
weave itself has a definite edge.&nbsp; On the other hand, a design
that represents a continuous band, such as a collar, headband,
necklace, ring, or bracelet that connects to itself <i>via the
weave</i> can be said to wrap either horizontally or
vertically.&nbsp; If you prefer to design the band so that it
crosses the design space from left to right, or vice versa, specify
the “horizontal” wrap.&nbsp; If, instead, you prefer the band to
cross the design space from top to bottom, specify the “vertical”
wrap.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In some cases, the choice of horizontal vs.
vertical wrap goes beyond preference into requirement because of
the orientation of the weave in the designer.&nbsp; For example,
one of my favorite weaves to make bracelets with is Dragonscale
(fourth from the left in the weave examples above), with all of the
small rings in rubber and the large rings in metal.&nbsp; Because
of the structure of the weave itself, if I have the band cross from
left to right (with horizontal wrap) the resulting bracelet has
almost no stretch along its length, but if I specify the band as
taller than it is wide (with vertical wrap) the resulting bracelet
has plenty of stretch to be pulled over the hand yet nestle snugly
against the wrist.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949744">Scale</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The scale of the design includes its width and
height and the actual sizes of the rings you will be using.</p>
<h4><a name="node0" id="node0"></a>Pattern Units, Rows &amp;
Columns, and Distance Measures</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The physical extent (width and height for a
vertical piece, or width and depth for a horizontal one, or width
and length for something like a bracelet) can be set when a design
is first being defined.&nbsp; The most natural measure for the
physical extent (at least from the viewpoint of building the
chainmaille) is in units of the weave itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">From a visual viewpoint, however, it can make
more sense to want to define the extent in terms of the visual rows
and columns; this allows you to more directly determine the
resolution of the image you would like to present so that the
important details (the hairiness of the squirrel, or the
readability of letters) will be sufficiently distinguishable.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">On the other hand, you may need to fill a
space that’s more easily defined in ordinary measures of distance,
whether it’s a cover for a small tabletop that’s 30 by 40
centimeters or a custom bracelet that needs to be 7-3/4 inches
long.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chainmaille Designer lets you do all of these,
and even to switch between them.&nbsp; As they say though, “some
restrictions apply”:&nbsp; to move between chainmaille units and
actual distances, you must have already decided on what weave you
want and what size(s) of rings you will be using.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you never err in estimating the size of
your work, more power to you!&nbsp; On the other hand, if, like me,
you occasionally discover, partway through execution, that you need
to alter the physical extent of your design, Chainmaille Designer
makes it easy to add to (or subtract from) any of the edges of your
design without invalidating the rest of the design.</p>
<h4><a name="node1" id="node1"></a>Ring Sizes</h4>
<h5><a name="node2" id="node2"></a>Inner Diameter and Wire
Gauge</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal">Ring sizes are typically given in terms of
their inner diameter (because you’ll be fitting other rings inside
that diameter) and the thickness of wire from which the rings are
made.&nbsp; The program adopts the convention of specifying the
inner diameters in inches and the thickness of the wire in the
American Wire Gauge (AWG).&nbsp; 18G 3/16, for example, specifies a
ring with an inside diameter of 3 16ths of an inch made of 18 gauge
wire.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A pattern file can specify any number of ring
sizes (or combinations of ring sizes for weaves that use more than
one ring size), and once you have chosen the weave, you will often
be able to choose the ring size(s) you wish to work with.&nbsp;
Don’t worry if the size you want isn’t part of the pattern file,
though; just keep in mind that conversion to distance units (per
above) may not be accurate in that case.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a tangential note, there are two principal
wire gauge systems, the AWG (also known as the B&amp;S gauge) and
the Standard Wire Gauge (SWG), which obviously wasn’t as standard
as it wanted to be.&nbsp; Because these gauges are really measures
of the area of the wire’s cross section, <i>not</i> its diameter,
neither one can be converted to distance using a simple conversion
factor.&nbsp; For example, to convert inches to AWG involves taking
the logarithm base 92.&nbsp; I have embedded the correct conversion
formulae deep inside the code, but most people use conversion
tables.</p>
<h5><a name="node3" id="node3"></a>Aspect Ratio</h5>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rings for weaves are often specified by aspect
ratio, or AR.&nbsp; This is simply the ratio obtained by dividing
the inside diameter of the ring (in distance units) by the
thickness of the wire (also in the same distance units).&nbsp; For
example, a weave can specify that it must be constructed using
rings with an AR of at least 3.2.&nbsp; Pay attention to these
specifications.&nbsp; Especially well-characterized weaves can
specify minimum, maximum, and ideal ARs.&nbsp; In general it will
not be possible to build a weave using rings below the minimum AR
because there is not enough room inside the rings for the other
rings to fit <img width="117" height="864" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image007.png" align=
"right" hspace="12" alt="image">into.&nbsp; Weaves built with ARs
close to the minimum will tend to be tight and inflexible.&nbsp;
Weaves built at the ideal AR will be “just right”.&nbsp; Weaves
built with ARs close to the maximum will tend to be loose and
floppy, while weaves built with ARs above the maximum may
completely lose pattern coherence or, in the case of captive ring
weaves, simply fall apart.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949745">Colors</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rings you will be using to depict the
subject matter of your design will typically be restricted in terms
of the colors available.&nbsp; Naturally, as you design, you’ll
want to use colors that are reasonably close to those of your
actual materials to get a better idea of what your design will look
like once it has been executed.</p>
<h4><a name="node4" id="node4"></a>Palettes</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A palette is a relatively small collection of
colors that represents the colors you have to work with (as
contrasted with the 16 million or so distinguishable colors, or
many more for some people).&nbsp; Chainmaille Designer allows you
to choose a palette for each of your designs.&nbsp; There are many
organizing principles possible for a collection of colors, but my
most important is:&nbsp; can I obtain rings in that color, and if
so, from where?&nbsp; My favorite supplier of rings is a Canadian
company, The Ring Lord, so as an example of what can be done, with
the idea that it may very well be sufficient for most people, I’ve
included a palette of the colors available from The Ring Lord.</p>
<h4><a name="node5" id="node5"></a>Palette Sections</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, The Ring Lord sells hundreds of different
sizes and shapes of rings in 19 materials (at last count), each
with its own range of colors.&nbsp; There’s a whole spectrum of
colors in anodized aluminum, a different spectrum in niobium,
another in EPDM (a latex-free rubber), more in enameled copper,
titanium, etc., and then there are the basic metals:&nbsp;
stainless steel, blackened steel, copper, brass, bright aluminum,
etc.&nbsp; I didn’t want to put them all into one great heap and
call it a palette, so I built in the ability to define palette
sections.&nbsp; For the Ring Lord palette, I created a palette
section for each material so that if I wanted to make a piece from
anodized aluminum it was clear exactly which colors I could work
with.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You don’t have to buy your rings from The Ring
Lord, or even use my palette, if you don’t want to, though.&nbsp;
Chainmaille Designer makes it easy for you to build palettes of
your own, even sampling photographs of the rings to get accurate
colors.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949746">Program Concepts</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">You don’t need to know all of these concepts
to work the program, but you will need them to understand how the
program works.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949747">IGP</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You’ve seen IGP this and IGP that throughout
this exposition, and you’ll see more later.&nbsp; What is IGP
anyway?&nbsp; IGP stands for Irregular Grid Painter, a program
written in Visual Basic by Zlosk around 2003 which anyone who was
designing inlays used (unless they were using hex grid
paper).&nbsp; For the first time ever, IGP allowed computer users
to color in rings in the context of their arrangement within a
weave to define a design.&nbsp; One of the principal design
criteria for the Chainmaille Designer was that it at least be able
to do what IGP did, preferably without invalidating anyone’s
previous designs or pattern definitions.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949748">Configuration Directories</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Configuration directories are just directories
of files (or, in Windows parlance, folders) that are where the
program expects to find certain kinds of files.&nbsp; Chainmaille
Designer expects to be told where to find pattern files, where to
find and put palette files, and where to find and put your
designs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the first things you’ll want to do if
you have designs that you used with IGP is either copy or move your
old files into the design directory configured for Chainmaille
Designer, or to use Chainmaille Designer’s Configuration window to
point to the directory in which your designs already reside.&nbsp;
[Note: it is not necessary to copy the weave pattern files.]</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949749">Files</a></h3>
<h4><a name="node6" id="node6"></a>Pattern Files</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A pattern file, as explained earlier, defines
a weave in a way that the program understands.&nbsp; Chainmaille
Designer understands the pattern files used by IGP (in the old .ini
file format) as well as the more capable XML pattern files
distributed with Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Both kinds of pattern file just have a
top-level description of the pattern.&nbsp; To implement the
pattern, they refer, in turn, to other files, mostly image
files.&nbsp; To successfully move a pattern file requires moving
the entire collection of related files as a unit.</p>
<h4><a name="node7" id="node7"></a>Palette Files</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A palette file represents a palette of
colors.&nbsp; A palette can be divided into sections, and each
section can define one or more optionally-named colors, either as
red-green-blue (RGB) triples or as hue-saturation-luminance (HSL)
triples.&nbsp; So, for example, a palette file may define a color
named “seafoam” in the “Anodized Alum.” section as having the HSL
values of 167, 110, 190.</p>
<h4><a name="node8" id="node8"></a>Design Files</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A design file represents a design.&nbsp; This
includes at least the weave used, the physical extent of the
design, and a reference to an image file that specifies the colors
assigned to each ring.&nbsp; If you have specified them in the
process of defining your design, the design file may also include
information about the color palette used, the size of rings used,
the overlay image (if any) and its positioning with respect to the
design, and information about who created the design, for whom it
was created, when it was created, and additional descriptive
matter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">A design file also carries some information
about how you set up your workspace.&nbsp; Some examples of this
kind of information are any guidelines you may have placed in your
design area and palette sections that you chose to hide while
working on the design.&nbsp; Using this information, opening a
saved design can set up the Designer pretty much the way it was
when the design was saved.</p>
<h4><a name="node9" id="node9"></a>Color Report Files</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like IGP before it, Chainmaille Designer can
save or print a file that summarizes how many rings of each color
are needed by the design as well as a row-by-row specification of
the order of ring colors in that row.&nbsp; These amount to step by
step instructions on how to construct the final work, provided one
already has a grasp of the weave itself.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949750">Images</a></h3>
<h4><a name="node10" id="node10"></a>Color Image</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A color image is an image in which each single
pixel represents the color of one ring.&nbsp; Using a color image
allows the design coloration to be represented in a much smaller
file than would be needed for a picture of the design with all of
the ring shapes.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="40" height="18" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image008.png" alt=
"image"><br>
Color image for Dragonscale bracelet of fire.</p>
<h4><a name="node11" id="node11"></a>Rendered Image</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">A rendered image is a picture of the design,
with the outlines of each ring where they ought to be, and each
ring colored appropriately.&nbsp; Normally, the rendered image is
built by the program using the design information from the design
file and maintained invisibly behind the scenes, but the rendered
image can be printed or saved to an image file (for reference while
building or for presentation to a client, for example).</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="576" height="168" id="Picture 4"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image009.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 4"><br>
Rendered image for Dragonscale bracelet of fire.</p>
<h4><a name="node12" id="node12"></a>Zoomed Image</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The zoomed image is the image that appears in
the design area of the main window.&nbsp; To build the zoomed image
that you view, the program takes just that portion of the rendered
image that ought to be visible and scales it up or down to fit the
design area.&nbsp; Because the scaling of the already-rendered
image is much faster than painting each ring, this allows the
program to respond with more alacrity as you zoom in and out and
pan around the design.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="561" height="315" id="Picture 60"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image010.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 60"><br>

Designer (340%).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Zooming into a design, especially a very large
design, can make it a lot easier to color exactly the rings you
want to color, particularly on today’s high-resolution
monitors.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949751">Onward!</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">By now you have a pretty good background for
being able to use and understand the program, so let’s get you
started with using the program, then we’ll resume our more detailed
discussion after that.</p>
