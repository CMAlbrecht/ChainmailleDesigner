<h1><a name="_Toc98949762">Managing Your Designs</a></h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949763">Using the Main Menu</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The main menu provides the operations with
which you create and manage your designs.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="436" height="33" id="Picture 51"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image024.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 51"></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949764">File</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The File menu allows you to begin a new
design, save a design, or open a previously-saved design.&nbsp; It
also allows you to save or print an image of your design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>New</b> – Begins the process of defining a
new design using the New Design window (see <b><i>Design
Information, New Design Window</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Open</b> – Allows you to choose a
previously-saved design from the Open Design window.&nbsp; In
addition to opening Chainmaille Designer design files, the image
files created by IGP (well, really, <b>any</b> image files) can be
opened as a design.&nbsp; [Image files don’t have weave information
(or anything other than colors), so after you open them you’ll need
to go to Design &gt; Info to set the weave and other design
parameters.]</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Close</b> – Closes the current design,
removing it from the designer (but not before prompting to save if
any changes were made).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Save Design</b> – Saves the design in its
design file.&nbsp; If no design file has yet been associated with
the design, prompts you for a design file name and location.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Save Design As</b> – Saves the design in a
(possibly) new design file, prompting you for a design file name
and location.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Save Rendered Image</b> – Saves an image of
the design, similar to that shown in the design area of the main
window, to an image file of your choosing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Print &gt; Rendered Image</b> – Prints an
image of the design, similar to that shown in the design area, to a
printer of your choosing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Exit</b> – Exits the Chainmaille Designer
program.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949765">Edit</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Undo</b> – Undoes the previous operation,
if possible.&nbsp; Ring painting, design or overlay rotations, and
color replacement operations performed in the current session may
be undone by making this menu choice or, more commonly, by using
the Ctrl-Z key combination.&nbsp; The number of consecutive
operations that can be undone is limited; see Configuration,
above.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Redo</b> - Reapplies the previously undone
operation, if possible.&nbsp; Ring painting, design or overlay
rotations, and color replacement operations that were recently
undone in the current session may be redone by making this menu
choice or, more commonly, by using the Ctrl-Y key
combination.&nbsp; The number of consecutive operations that can be
re-done is limited (see Configuration, above), and if any other
operations have been performed since the most recent undo or redo,
previously undone operations are no longer available to be
re-done.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949766">Design</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Design menu allows you to review or change
the parameters of your design.&nbsp; It also allows you set
guidelines and to bring in an overlay image to act as a guide to
coloring the rings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Info</b> – Shows design parameters in the
Design Information window, from which the design parameters can
also be changed (see <b><i>Design Information, Design Information
Window</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Hide</b> – If guidelines
are defined for the design and are being shown, hides them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Show</b> – If guidelines
are defined for the design but are hidden, shows them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Horizontal</b> – Adds a
horizontal guideline to the design at the next position you click
within the design area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Vertical</b> – Adds a
vertical guideline to the design at the next position you click
within the design area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Halves</b> – Adds
guidelines to the design which divide the design into halves both
vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Thirds</b> – Adds
guidelines to the design which divide the design into thirds both
vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Quarters</b> – Adds
guidelines to the design which divide the design into quarters both
vertically and horizontally.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Guidelines &gt; Clear All</b> – Clears all
of the guidelines from the design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overlay &gt; Open</b> – Begins the process
of setting up an overlay image.&nbsp; An overlay image is shown
semi-transparently over your design as an aid to assigning ring
colors (see <b><i>Overlays</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overlay &gt; Hide</b> – If an overlay is
defined for the design and is being shown, hides it.&nbsp; On the
keyboard, alt-o hides or shows the overlay.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overlay &gt; Show</b> – If an overlay is
defined for the design but is hidden, shows it. &nbsp;On the
keyboard, alt-o hides or shows the overlay.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overlay &gt; Rotate &gt; Clockwise</b> – If
an overlay is defined for the design, rotates it a quarter-turn
clockwise while leaving the underlying design as it is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Overlay &gt; Rotate &gt;
Counterclockwise</b> – If an overlay is defined for the design,
rotates it a quarter-turn counterclockwise while leaving the
underlying design as it is.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Rotate &gt; Clockwise</b> – Rotates the
entire design (including its overlay, if any) a quarter-turn
clockwise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Rotate &gt; Counterclockwise</b> – Rotates
the entire design (including its overlay, if any) a quarter-turn
counterclockwise.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Rotation operations, either of the design or
of the overlay, can be undone (see Undo, above, under Edit).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949767">Colors</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Colors menu provides access to the color
counter and the ability to replace colors already in your design
with other colors.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Count Colors</b> – Displays a report
showing how many rings of each color will be required to execute
the design (see <b><i>Counting Colors</i></b>, below).&nbsp; From
this summary report, a more detailed report can also be
obtained.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Replace in Design</b> – Displays a window
which allows you to replace selected colors of your design with
other colors, either from the current palette or arbitrarily chosen
(see <b><i>Replacing Colors in Your Design</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Color replacement operations can be undone
(see Undo, above, under Edit).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Color Rings from Overlay</b> – Assigns
colors to the rings based on the colors of the overlay image, but
restricted to the colors in a chosen palette section (see
<b><i>Coloring Rings from the Overlay</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Clear All Ring Colors</b> – Returns all of
the rings in the design to the uncolored state.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949768">Window</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Window menu controls the visibility of
Chainmaille Designer windows.&nbsp; At present, only the palette
window can be controlled in this way.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Hide Palette</b> – If the palette window is
being shown, hides it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Show Palette</b> – If the palette window is
currently hidden, shows it.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949769">Help</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Help menu provides access to the “About
box” and to program configuration as well as the expected advice
about how to use the program.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>About Chainmaille Designer</b> – Displays
an informational window identifying the program, its creator, and
its reason for existence.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Configuration</b> – Shows program
configuration parameters (directories and user information) and
allows these to be changed (see <b><i>Directories and File
Organization</i></b>, below).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Show Help</b> – Displays the contents of
this manual in web help file form with a table of contents, an
alphabetical list of topics, and the ability to search for a term
of interest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>License Agreement</b> – Displays the
license agreement that you agreed to when installing the
program.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949770">Directories and File
Organization</a></h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949771">Directories</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chainmaille Designer expects the files it
works with to be found within one of three particular directories
(also known as folders):</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Design Files</b> directory – This is where
Chainmaille Designer expects to find (and put) your designs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Weave Pattern Files</b> directory – This
directory contains all of the chainmaille weave pattern definition
files available for use with the Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Palette Files</b> directory – This
directory contains palette definition files, which define the
colors for your designs.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These directories are created in a default
location (nominally C:\Chainmaille Designer) at installation
time.&nbsp; If you wish to change, for example, the place where
your designs are stored, you can do so through the Configuration
Window.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949772">Using the Configuration Window</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">To view or change the configuration, begin by
selecting Help &gt; Configuration from the main menu.&nbsp; The
Configuration window will appear.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="621" height="288" id="Picture 53"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image025.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 53"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The current definitions for the three
directories are displayed in the upper area of the window.&nbsp; To
change one of them, click on the button with the ellipsis (…) to
the right of the directory.&nbsp;&nbsp; This brings up a standard
directory-choosing window from which you can set the directory you
wish to use.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="320" height="339" id="Picture 44"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image026.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 44"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Configuration window also provides a place
for you to enter your name, or the name of your company or
organization, as the originator of your designs.&nbsp; This
information, if present, will be included in each of the designs
you create with the Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although the default value is typically more
than adequate, the undo history limit (the number of recent
operations remembered for a session) can also be altered in the
Configuration window.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949773">File Organization</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Within the design and palette files
directories, you are free to organize your files however you see
fit.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The weave pattern files directory is a little
more restricted:&nbsp; in general, each weave must have its own
directory which contains all of the files necessary to work with
that weave.&nbsp; This includes (at least) a weave definition file
(either XML or .ini) and one or more image files.&nbsp; Above that
level, up to the weave pattern files directory itself, you can
organize the weaves however you like, but there is rarely any
reason to do so:&nbsp; when needed, the program hunts through all
of the files and folders under the weave pattern files directory
for weave definitions and presents them all in the Choose a Weave
window, irrespective of the organization of their directories.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc98949774">Creating a Design</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin creating a new design, select File
&gt; New from the main menu.&nbsp; This displays the New Design
window.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949775">New Design Window</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The New Design window has two tabs.&nbsp; The
Weave and Size tab is where all of the essential information is
entered.&nbsp; The Information tab is for entering more descriptive
information.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="474" height="307" id="Picture 18"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image027.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 18"></p>
<h4><a name="node13" id="node13"></a>Name</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the top of the Weave and Size tab, enter a
name for the design.&nbsp; This name is the basis for the names of
the design file and its related files, so it shouldn’t be left
blank, be too general, or be too long.</p>
<h4><a name="node14" id="node14"></a>Weave</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next, choose a weave for the design.&nbsp;
Ordinarily, this defaults to the weave you used most
recently.&nbsp; To change the weave from the default (or set the
weave if no default is displayed), click on the Change button next
to the box where the weave name is shown.&nbsp; This displays the
Choose a Weave window.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949776">Choose a Weave Window</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Choose a Weave Window presents all of the
weaves in the configured weave pattern files directory (Help &gt;
Configuration to change the directory).&nbsp; You can select a
weave for your design from the list of available weaves by either
double-clicking on it or single-clicking to select it, then
clicking the OK button.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="401" id="Picture 19"

<p class="MsoNormal">Alternatively, you can switch to the Gallery
view and choose from amongst the weave images in the same way.</p>

alt="image" name="Picture 21"></p>
<h4><a name="node15" id="node15"></a>Wrap</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once the weave is chosen, the next choice is
the topology of the design, known more simply as the wrap.&nbsp;
For most projects, the default wrap of none is appropriate.&nbsp;
If, however, your design is to be woven in the form of a cylinder
(a continuous bracelet, for example) then you’ll want to specify
the wrap as horizontal (if the left edge is woven into the right
edge) or vertical (if the top is woven into the bottom).</p>

<p class="MsoCaption" align="left" style='text-align:left'>
&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes this choice depends on the
orientation in which the weave is presented in the Designer.&nbsp;
As an example, Dragonscale is very stiff in one direction (the
horizontal direction as the Designer shows it by default) but quite
mobile (expandable and compressible) in the other direction
(vertical in the Designer).&nbsp; To make stretchy Dragonscale
bracelets (using rubber for the small rings and metal for the large
ones), I have to set it up so that the stretch that is needed is
along the mobile direction, so I specify a vertical wrap and orient
the bracelet so that its length is from top to bottom of the design
area.&nbsp; (Then, once I am back in the design area, I rotate the
design so that the length of the bracelet lies horizontally across
my screen.)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you are using one of the old IGP weaves
that do not have edges or corners, the wrap is still useful
information about the design, but you will not see a difference in
how your design appears in the Designer.&nbsp; At present, only
weaves with “DE” in their name (for “Dragon Enchained”) specify
edges and corners, but I expect this to change.</p>
<h4><a name="node16" id="node16"></a>Scale</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next choice is the choice of scale:&nbsp;
What ring sizes will you be using to execute the design.&nbsp; This
choice is based on the ring sizes defined in the weave pattern
files, and to date there are not any which define more than one
scale.&nbsp; This means that the scale box will either be empty and
have no choices (if the weave didn’t define a scale) or will have
some rings sizes but not allow a choice of alternate ring sizes (if
the weave defined only one scale).&nbsp; Not really much of a
choice at present, but I’ll show you later how to add scale
information for your favorite ring sizes to your favorite weaves,
after which this selection will be more useful.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">If the weave also defines the number of weave
units that fit within an inch horizontally and vertically, then
there is enough information to convert weave units to distance
units (inches or centimeters).&nbsp; When this is the case, it
allows the design size (in the next section of the window) to be
specified in inches or centimeters.&nbsp; Regrettably, only one
weave, DEDragonscale, had this information at the time of
release.</p>
<h4><a name="node17" id="node17"></a>Design Size</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The last area of the Weave and Size tab is the
Design Size section.&nbsp; This has a units selector and areas to
enter the width and height of the design in the selected
units.&nbsp; The possible units are:</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>units</b> – Weave units as defined by the
weave pattern file.&nbsp; These are repeating elements that
collectively define the weave.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>rows &amp; columns</b> – Visual rows and
columns (see discussion of Scale in <b><i>Design Concepts</i></b>,
above).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>pixels</b> – Number of pixels in the color
image (see <b><i>Program Concepts</i></b>, above).&nbsp; Not
recommended.&nbsp; This was the only way to specify design size in
the IGP, so it is here for those who are used to it, but it depends
on the way in which the weave file defines the arrangement of
colors for the weave units, which is non-obvious.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>inches</b> – Distance measured in
inches.&nbsp; This option is not presented if the weave file
doesn’t have enough information to relate weave units to distance
units.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>centimeters</b> – Distance measured in
centimeters.&nbsp; This option is not presented if the weave file
doesn’t have enough information to relate weave units to distance
units.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Specify the size of your design by entering a
width and height.&nbsp; If you select units other than the units of
the chainmaille weave, you’ll be presented with another
choice:&nbsp; whether the specified size should be treated as a
minimum or maximum given that the design will have an integral
number of chainmaille units in each direction.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="246" height="135" id="Picture 22"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image034.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 22"><br>
<br></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, if you are making a close-fitting
bracelet or collar to measure, you would most likely want to round
up because rounding down might make the piece unwearable.&nbsp; On
the other hand, if the project is a cover for the floor of a box,
rounding down would be a better choice.</p>
<h4><a name="node18" id="node18"></a>Descriptive Information</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The second tab of the New Design window is the
Information tab which allows other information about the design to
be recorded:&nbsp; who created the design, when, and for whom, as
well as any other notes you like.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="426" height="276" id="Picture 17"

<p class="MsoNormal">The Designed By field is pre-populated with
the information entered in the Configuration window (see
<b><i>Directories and File Organization</i></b>, above).&nbsp; The
Date field is pre-populated with the current date and time,
UTC.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you click the OK button of the New Design
window, an uncolored chainmaille design will be created from your
specifications and displayed in the design area of the main
window.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949778">Saving a Design</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To save a design, select File &gt; Save from
the main menu.&nbsp; If the design has not previously been saved,

<h3><a name="_Toc98949781">IGP Image Files</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">To open a design created by the old IGP,
change the file filter (the drop-down choice in the lower left of
the file-choosing window, just above the Open button) from Design

the size of your design.</p>
<h4><a name="node19" id="node19"></a>Changing the Weave of a
Design</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To change the weave of your design, click on
the Change button to the right of the name of the weave.&nbsp; This
brings up the Choose a Weave window, previously described, from
which you can select a different weave.&nbsp; Once a different
weave has been selected, you may also have different Scale choices
to choose from.&nbsp; From this point, clicking on the OK button of
the Design Information window will cause the new weave selection to
be applied to your design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As an example of when this might be handy,
when I will be using European 4-in-1 I often prefer to sketch in
the design using the SmallHex pattern.&nbsp; It’s a little easier
to paint on the contiguous hex tiles and is close enough for the
roughing in.&nbsp; With the initial design painted, I then switch
to the real weave, say DE-Euro4in1, to check the ring directions at
all the color transitions, adjusting ring colors on the boundaries
as required.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Changing the weave of an existing design can
have unexpected results.&nbsp; Despite the similarity in name, for
example, Japanese 4-in-1 is not at all like European 4-in-1 from a
structural point of view, so switching an established design from
one weave to the other may result in breaking up lines or color
boundaries, or otherwise distorting the graphic image.&nbsp; If you
don’t like the result of a change of weave, the best recovery is to
re-open the Design Information window and change it back, without
saving in between.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Because of the potential distortion, instead
of reading in a previous design and changing its weave, consider
saving the rendered image of the previous design (File &gt; Save
Rendered Image), then using the rendered image of the previous
design as an overlay for the new design (see the chapter on
<b><i>Overlays</i></b>, below, for how to do this).</p>
<h4><a name="node20" id="node20"></a>Changing the Size of a
Design</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chainmaille Designer also lets you adjust the
size of your design by adding units to (or removing units from) any
of the edges of your design.&nbsp; This is useful when you
discover, for example, that the thickness of the bracelet you are
making means that you’ll need 2 more rows of units to go around the
intended wrist and you want to design the additional rows to blend
in seamlessly with the rest of the design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin changing the design size, click on
the Change Size button in the Design Size area of the Design
Information window.&nbsp; This causes the Change Design Size window
to appear.</p>

Change Design Size window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This window presents the total size of your
design (in the center) and provides areas at top, left, right, and
bottom to specify a number of additional units for each of the four
edges.&nbsp; (To accommodate size reductions, the number of
additional units can be negative.)&nbsp; Also note that the upper
right corner of the Design Size Adjustment area has a units
selector; by default adjustments are in weave pattern units but, as
with the original size specification, you can also specify the
adjustment amounts in visual rows and columns, inches or
centimeters (if you’ve selected a scale for your design), or (for
inveterate IGP users) pixels of the color image.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you enter adjustments for any of the four
sides, the overall size (in the center) will also change.&nbsp; For
our hypothetical bracelet that needs two more rows, we could just
leave the units selector alone, enter 2 into the top edge box, and
click OK.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Exiting the Change Design Size window returns
you to the Design Information window.&nbsp; Any design size changes
you specified are not actually applied to your design until you
also click on the OK button of the Design Information window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clicking on the OK button of the Design
Information window finalizes your changes (if any) and implements
them in your design.&nbsp; Any changes to the appearance of your
design will be shown in the design area of the main window.</p>
