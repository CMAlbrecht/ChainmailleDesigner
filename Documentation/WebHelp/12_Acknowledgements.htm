<h1><a name="_Toc95395435">Acknowledgements</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">No software is produced in a vacuum.&nbsp;
This program owes its existence to all who have gone before, a long
line of mathematicians and computer engineers, and most especially
to all computer programmers and developers of computer languages,
beginning with Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace, and
continuing through the C lineage left us by Dennis Ritchie, Bjarne
Stoustrup and many others.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This particular work owes much of its form and
function to Zlosk, the creator of the original Irregular Grid
Painter.&nbsp; Chainmaillers everywhere, and I in particular, owe
him a debt of gratitude which I hope this program begins to
repay.&nbsp; My thanks also to those who contributed pattern files
and/or features to the IGP:&nbsp; Tawnos for the Trinity weave,
Clawe for European 6-in-1, B Pannell for the knit patterns, MaxumX
and Leatherwing for the Persian weaves, and Dunedon for the
original color counter.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Celtic_Chainman, MusicMan, Zlosk, and
TrenchCoatGuy on the M.A.I.L. forum were particularly helpful with
earlier versions of the Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The implementations of the DEDragonscale and
DE-Euro4in1 weaves distributed with this program were almost
entirely dependent on the skill and persistence of my wife, Elsa
DieLöwin.&nbsp; Without her work, the edge and corner treatments of
the weave sheets couldn’t have happened.</p>
