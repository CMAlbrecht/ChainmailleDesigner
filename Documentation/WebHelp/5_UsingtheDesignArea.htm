<h1><a name="_Toc98949785">Using the Design Area</a></h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949786">Painting Rings</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When painting rings, you’ll be selecting
colors to paint with from the palette, then clicking or dragging in
the design area to paint in those colors, then going back to the
palette to pick different colors, then doing more painting, etc. so
it makes sense to set up the palette window and the main window
side-by-side.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="296" id=
"Picture 115" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image039.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 115"></p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949787">Using the Standard Palette</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The palette window displays the current
palette.&nbsp; To show or hide the palette window, select Window
&gt; Show Palette or Window &gt; Hide Palette from the menu of the
main design window.&nbsp; The palette window can also be hidden by
clicking the X in the upper right corner of the palette window
itself.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To use the standard palette, select Palette
&gt; Open from the menu at the top of the palette window, then
locate and select the Ring Lord Colors file using the standard
file-choosing window that appears.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="280" id="Picture 9"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image040.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 9"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the Open button of the file-choosing
window to have the Designer read the selected palette file.&nbsp;
(Alternatively, you can double-click on the file to choose and open
it.)&nbsp; The palette window will then show the colors from that
palette and make them available for painting.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949788">Palette Sections</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The standard palette is divided into sections,
each of which has the colors available for a particular ring
material.&nbsp; You can collapse palette sections which you are not
using for your design, hiding their colors, by clicking on the
section names.&nbsp; When you save your design, it will remember
which sections are collapsed, and restore the palette to the
correct state for your design when you re-open the saved
design.&nbsp; To expand a collapsed palette section, just click on
the section name again.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949789">Selecting Colors to Paint With</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can paint with either the left or right
mouse button, assigning a different color to each.&nbsp; Clicking
on a color patch in the palette with the left mouse button assigns
that color to the left mouse button.&nbsp; Similarly, clicking on a
color patch with the right mouse button assigns that color to the
right button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you assign a color to a button, the image
at the top of the palette window changes to indicate your
selection.&nbsp; The left-hand ring of the image shows the color
you chose for the left mouse button.&nbsp; The right-hand ring
shows the color you chose for the right mouse button.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949790">Coloring the Rings</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Moving to the design area, you can then assign
a color to a ring by clicking within the outline of the ring with
either the left or right button, depending on which color you want
to the ring to be.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also hold down one button or the other
and move the mouse in a sweeping motion to paint a bunch of rings
more continuously than clicking on individual rings would
allow.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Remember also that ring painting operations
can be undone, and if you undo too much, re-done (provided you
don’t perform some other operation between the undo and the
redo).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949791">Un-coloring Rings</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to coloring rings, you can also
<i>un-color</i> rings.&nbsp; This makes the rings transparent
(although their outlines will still be visible, they have no color
of their own and the background color shows through).&nbsp;
Transparent rings are not considered part of your design and will
not be counted when determining how many rings of each color your
design requires.&nbsp; To un-color (or un-paint) one or more rings,
hold down the Alt key of your keyboard, then click (or
click-and-drag) in the design area with either mouse button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Using selective un-coloring, you can define
chainmaille panels of any non-rectangular shape you like simply by
designating the rings in the unused areas of the rectangular design
space to be transparent.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also un-color all of the rings at once
by selecting Colors &gt; Clear All Ring Colors from the menu.</p>
<h3><img width="94" height="1" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image041.png" align=
"right" hspace="12" alt="image"><a name="_Toc98949792">Painting
Rings of a Particular Size</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If your weave uses rings of more than one
size, you can restrict your painting to rings of a particular size
by setting the Ring Sizes control to the size of ring that you want
to paint.&nbsp; For example, if you’re using DEDragonscale as your
weave and want to paint only the small rings with that color, click
on the “S” radio button and from that point on, any painting you do
will affect only the small rings.&nbsp; Similarly, the “L” choice
restricts painting to the large rings.&nbsp; To resume painting on
all ring sizes, click on the “All Rings” radio button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Ring Sizes control is not shown unless
your weave uses more than one ring size.</p>
<h2><img width="92" height="1" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image042.png" align=
"right" hspace="12" alt="image"><a name="_Toc98949793">Painting
Lines and Other Shapes</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">The painting controls allow you to easily
paint straight lines and fill areas with color.&nbsp; If you’re as
finicky as I am, you’ll likely want to fine tune the color
boundaries afterward by painting individual rings, but painting in
shapes provides a way to quickly rough in the elements of a
design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In addition to the Ring Sizes control which we
saw earlier, the painting controls also include choices for Shapes
and Fill and an unobtrusive progress bar just below the Fill box
which provides assurance during long-running fill operations that
something is actually happening.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Like ring painting, shape painting can be
undone, and if you undo too much, re-done (provided you don’t
perform some other operation between the undo and the redo).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949794">The Shapes Control</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">You select what kind of shape you want to draw
by clicking on the appropriate button for that shape in the Shapes
control.&nbsp; Using this control, you can paint straight lines,
rectangles, ellipses (including circles) and polygons.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949795">The Fill Control</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Fill control allows you to specify whether
you want a solid area of color (“Solid”), or just an outline of
color around the edge of the shape (“Hollow”).&nbsp; If you’re just
drawing a straight line, the setting for the Fill control has no
effect.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949796">Painting a Shape</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before painting a shape, make sure that you
have the right color set for one of your mouse buttons.&nbsp; I
prefer to also set up the Ring Sizes control (if showing) and the
Fill control before beginning to define the shape.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Begin painting a shape by clicking on one of
the Shapes choices other than “Freehand”.&nbsp; Once you have
selected a shape, you should keep an eye on the status bar area at
the bottom edge of the window.&nbsp; This area will provide brief
instructions for each step in the shape painting operation.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Defining a shape does not involve clicking and
dragging, just clicking (or shift-clicking in some cases).</p>
<h4><a name="node21" id="node21"></a>Your First Click Sets the
Color</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Defining a shape requires two or more
clicks.&nbsp; Your first click determines the color for the shape;
if done with the left button the shape gets the color assigned to
the left button, if done with the right button the shape will have
the color assigned to the right button.</p>
<h4><a name="node22" id="node22"></a>Painting a Line</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To paint a line, click once to set the
beginning of the line, then a second time to set the end of the
line.&nbsp; After the first click, you’ll see a preview of the line
as you move the mouse around.</p>
<h4><a name="node23" id="node23"></a>Painting a Rectangle</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To paint a rectangle, click once to set one
corner of the rectangle, then a second time to set the opposite
corner of the rectangle. &nbsp;After the first click, you’ll see a
preview of the rectangle as you move the mouse around.</p>
<h4><a name="node24" id="node24"></a>Painting an Ellipse or
Circle</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To paint an ellipse or circle, click once to
set the center of the ellipse or circle.&nbsp; The second click is
either a regular click to paint a circle or a shift-click to paint
an ellipse.&nbsp; After the first click you’ll see previews of both
alternatives, the circle and the ellipse, as you move the mouse
around.</p>
<h4><a name="node25" id="node25"></a>Painting a Polygon</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To paint a polygon, click once to set the
first vertex (corner) of the polygon, then again for each
subsequent vertex.&nbsp; Complete the polygon by shift-clicking on
the final vertex.&nbsp; After the first click, you’ll see a preview
of the polygon as it would be if you completed it as you move the
mouse around.&nbsp; A polygon requires at least three vertices, of
course, so can’t be completed until two previous vertices have been
set.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949797">Cancelling Shape Painting</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you’re midway through defining a shape to
be painted, you can cancel the operation by choosing “Freehand”
from the Shapes control.&nbsp; Once you’ve completed defining the
shape and painting has begun it’s too late to cancel, though.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="350" id=
"Picture 127" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image043.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 127"></p>
<p class="MsoCaption">Shape painting:&nbsp; here we have a solid
red star-shaped polygon (all rings), a solid yellow ellipse (all
rings) overpainted with a solid orange ellipse (small rings only),
a solid green circle (all rings) overpainted with a hollow blue
circle (large rings only), all framed by a hollow lime-green
rectangle (large rings only).</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949798">When Shape Painting is Complete</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">After the definition of a shape has been
completed, the actual painting begins, behind the scenes.&nbsp;
Lines and hollow shapes are generally completed fairly quickly, but
solid fills, depending on the area covered, can take a while to
complete.&nbsp; When this is the case, the shape progress bar, just
below the fill box, indicates how far along the process is.&nbsp;
Once the painting is complete, the newly-rendered image is
displayed in the design area.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After painting a shape, the Shapes control is
reset to the default Freehand ring-painting mode.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sometimes, depending on the weave and the
exact placement of your clicks, lines or hollow figures can have
gaps where the lines or shape boundaries pass between rings without
touching them.&nbsp; You can often re-paint a line, using slightly
different click locations, to correct this, or you can use the
Freehand painting mode to correct any issues ring by ring.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949799">Outline and Background Colors</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">From the palette window, you can also change
the color with which the rings are outlined (using the Set Outline
Color button) or the color of the background of your design (using
the Set Background button).&nbsp; Either of these actions will
cause the Choose a Color window to appear (see <b><i>Defining
Palettes</i></b>, below), from which you can specify the
corresponding color.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949800">Zoom and Scroll</a></h2>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949801">Zoom</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Zoom adjustments allow you to focus in on a
detail area or to view the entirety of your design.&nbsp; The zoom
controls can be found in the lower right corner of the main
window.&nbsp; There are five ways to adjust the zoom in Chainmaille
Designer.</p>
<h4><a name="node26" id="node26"></a>The Zoom
Slider&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="141" height="25" id=
"Picture 12" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image044.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 12"></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">The zoom slider allows zoom adjustment from 1%
(on the left end) to 10,000% (on the right).&nbsp; The scale of the
slider is logarithmic, with 100% in the center.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Chainmaille Designer limits small zoom factors
so that at least a few pixels are shown in the design area, so the
zoom slider may not go all the way to its left edge unless you have
a large design.</p>
<h4><a name="node27" id="node27"></a>The Zoom Entry
Window&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="67" height="24" id=
"Picture 13" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image045.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 13"></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">To use the zoom entry window, simply type your
desired zoom over the currently displayed number.&nbsp; The zoom is
adjusted as you type.</p>
<h4><a name="node28" id="node28"></a>The 100%
Button&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="55" height="25" id=
"Picture 14" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image046.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 14"></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clicking the 100% button returns the zoom to
the original 100%, scrolled so that the center of your design is in
the center of the design area.&nbsp; Note that this doesn’t really
mean that the image on the screen is the same size as your finished
article will be, unless your monitor happens to be set for the old
72 pixels per inch standard; most modern monitors have much finer
resolution than that.&nbsp; It just means that each pixel of the
invisibly-maintained rendered image is shown in one pixel of the
design area.</p>
<h4><a name="node29" id="node29"></a>The Fit
Button&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="51" height="25" id=
"Picture 15" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image047.png" alt=
"image" name="Picture 15"></h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clicking the Fit button adjusts the zoom and
scroll so that the entirety of your design is visible in the design
area of the main window.</p>
<h4><a name="node30" id="node30"></a>The Mouse Wheel</h4>
<p class="MsoNormal">When the mouse cursor is over the design area
of the main window, you can use the mouse wheel (if you have one)
to zoom in and out.&nbsp; Zooming using the mouse is a little
special.&nbsp; The other zoom controls keep the center of the
design area in the same position within your design.&nbsp; When you
use the mouse to zoom, though, the part of your design that is
under the mouse cursor stays in the same place.&nbsp; This allows
you to, for example, point the mouse at a detail, then zoom in on
that detail without having to also fuss with the scroll bars.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949802">Scroll</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Any time the zoom is such that your entire
design can’t be seen, scroll bars appear at the right and/or bottom
edges.&nbsp; These work like scroll bars everywhere else:&nbsp; to
adjust which portion of your design is displayed, click and hold
the mouse on one of the rectangular indicators in the bar and slide
it up and down (or left and right).&nbsp; Release the mouse button
when you are done with your adjustment.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949803">Guidelines</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can also set up guidelines to help you in
your design work.&nbsp; These appear as horizontal or vertical
lines across your entire design space (bright pink by default, so
you can’t mistake them for anything else).&nbsp; Using the Design
&gt; Guidelines choice of the main menu (see <b><i>Managing Your
Designs</i></b>, above) you can easily set guidelines to divide up
your design into equal parts or set horizontal or vertical
guidelines at points you specify with a mouse click.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When guidelines are specified, they become
part of your design.&nbsp; When you save your design, the positions
of the guidelines are saved in the design file, and when you open a
saved design, any guidelines you had at the time the design was
saved will be restored.&nbsp; Guidelines will not, however, be
printed when you print your design, nor will they appear when you
save the rendered image of your design to an image file.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You can use the Design &gt; Guidelines &gt;
Hide / Show menu choice to turn the display of guidelines off and
on during the course of your work, and when you no longer need
them, you can remove them from your design by selecting Design &gt;
Guidelines &gt; Clear All.</p>
<h3><a name="_Toc98949804">Guidelines, Zoom, and Rotation</a></h3>
<p class="MsoNormal">Guidelines are placed relative to your
design.&nbsp; This means that they will touch the same rings
regardless of any zooming in and out you do.&nbsp; They also rotate
with your design when you rotate it.&nbsp; Be aware that when you
place a new vertical or horizontal guideline on a rotated design
that it will be vertical or horizontal in your current view of the
design.</p>
