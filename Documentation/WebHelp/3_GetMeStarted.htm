<h1><a name="_Toc98949752">Get Me Started!!</a></h1>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949753">First Impressions</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you bring up the program, you will see
two windows.&nbsp; The narrow window is for your palette of ring
colors.&nbsp; The wider window is your main window, dominated by
the design area in the center, with menus on the top and a few
indicators and controls on the bottom and the right side.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="92" height="271" id="Picture 36"

"270" id="Picture 40" src=

"image" name="Picture 40"><br>
The palette window and main window of Chainmaille Designer.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We won’t need the palette just yet, but it is
always on top when shown.&nbsp; This is how it should be when
you’re doing what you’ll mostly be doing, painting rings, but it
can get in the way when you’re first setting up a design, so hide
the palette by clicking on the X in the upper right corner of the
palette window.&nbsp; (We’ll get it back later when we’re ready to
paint rings.)</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949754">Configuration</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Before we try anything else we should set up
the configuration which tells the program where to find the various
kinds of files.&nbsp; To begin, select Help &gt; Configuration from
the menu.&nbsp; The Configuration window appears.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="621" height="288" id="Picture 39"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image013.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 39"><br>
Configuration window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are three configurable directories, one
for your designs, one for the pattern files that define the weaves,
and one for the palette files that define the colors you can work
with.&nbsp; If the configuration as installed works for you, jolly
good!&nbsp; If not, you can change any of the directories by
clicking on the browse button (the one with the ellipsis, …) next
to the directory you wish to change.&nbsp; This brings up a
standard directory-choosing window from which you can navigate to
the directory you wish to use.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While you’re in the configuration window,
enter your name or the name of your business or organization in the
Designed By field.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Although the default value is typically more
than adequate, the undo history limit (the number of recent
operations remembered for a session) can also be altered in this
window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Finally, click on the OK button to return to
the main window.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949755">Copy Old Files (if any)</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">If you have design image files from IGP, now
is the time to copy or move them into the design directory you’ve
configured for Chainmaille Designer.&nbsp; I have already converted
all of the old IGP weave patterns that I could find to work with
Chainmaille Designer, so you shouldn’t have to move those, but if
you have any special ones you can copy them into the weave pattern
files directory as they are.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949756">Start a New Design</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To begin the design process, take a moment to
think of what you might want to do, then select File &gt; New from
the menu.&nbsp; The New Design window appears.&nbsp; This window
has two tabs, the Weave and Size tab for the essential properties
of the design and the Information tab for other information about
the design.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="474" height="307" id="Picture 34"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image014.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 34"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the top of the first tab, enter a name for
the design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Next, choose a weave for the design.&nbsp;
Ordinarily, this defaults to the weave you used most recently, but
this is your first time in so go ahead and click on the Change
button next to the space where the weave name would be.&nbsp; This
brings up the Choose a Weave window.&nbsp; You can select a weave
from the list by either double-clicking on it or single-clicking to
select it, then clicking the OK button.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="505" height="324" id="Picture 46"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image015.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 46"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Alternatively, you can switch to the Gallery
view and choose from amongst the weave images in the same way.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="504" height="273" id="Picture 5"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image016.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 5"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Once you select a weave, you’ll be back in the
New Design window where you can set the wrap and, if more than one
scale was defined for the weave you chose, the scale for the
design.&nbsp; (If there’s only one scale in the weave pattern file,
it will be preselected for you.)</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="474" height="307" id="Picture 37"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image014.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 37"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Specify the size of your design by entering a
width and height.&nbsp; By default, this is in the natural units of
the selected weave.&nbsp; If you wish, you may first set the units
in which the design is specified.&nbsp; If you do select units
other than the units of the chainmaille weave, you’ll be faced with
yet another choice:&nbsp; whether the specified size should be
treated as a minimum or maximum given that the design will have an
integral number of chainmaille units in each direction.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="246" height="135" id="Picture 24"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image017.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 24"><br>
<br></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Click on the information tab to enter whatever
additional information you want to be carried with the
design.&nbsp; The Date defaults to now (in UTC) and the Designed By
field defaults to whatever you entered in the Configuration window
(you did enter that, right?).</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="474" height="307" id="Picture 35"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image018.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 35"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When all of the initial design information is
entered to your satisfaction, click on the OK button.&nbsp; A new,
uncolored design will be created from the information you entered
and it will be displayed in the central design area of the main
window.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc98949757">The (Nearly) Blank Canvas</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">With the preliminaries out of the way, you’ll
be able to see the beginnings of your first design on the main
window.&nbsp; Before you jump into painting, take a few moments to
notice what’s already there.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="624" height="350" id=

A new uncolored design.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">First, there’s something in the design
area!&nbsp; Yay!&nbsp; It is even the size you told it to be.&nbsp;
In the case above, the initial zoom is 100% but the design is
rather tall compared to its width so you can’t see the whole thing
(the scroll bar on the right is also a clue).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are four zoom controls along the bottom
of the window.&nbsp; Go ahead and play with them to get a feel for
how they work.&nbsp; There is the slider (the middle position is
100%), the entry field that lets you type in a zoom factor, the
100% button which instantly returns the zoom to 100%, and the Fit
button which adjusts the zoom so that the entire design is
visible.&nbsp; If you position the mouse cursor over the design
area, you can also use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Along the right edge are the painting
controls.&nbsp; We’ll get to them a bit later.</p>

"right" hspace="12" alt="image"><a name=
"_Toc98949758">Painting</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is now time to color some rings, but the
colors are in palettes and we told the palette window to hide
itself, so the first thing to do is to bring the palette window
back by selecting Window &gt; Show Palette from the menu.&nbsp; The
palette window reappears, but it looks nearly empty.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To fill the window with the vivid colors you
crave, you’ll need to open a palette file.&nbsp; Using the Palette
menu on the palette window itself, select Palette &gt; Open.&nbsp;
This brings up a standard file open window, and if the
configuration is correct it will start in the directory where the
standard palette file (Ring Lord Colors) is stored.&nbsp; To begin
using the standard palette, double click on the Ring Lord Colors
file (or select it, then click on the Open button).</p>

<h2><img width="154" height="450" src=
"Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image022.png" align=
"right" hspace="12" alt="image"><a name="_Toc98949759">Using the
Palette</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">That’s more like it.&nbsp; Now we see lots of
colors.&nbsp; How can we use them?&nbsp; Nothing could be
easier.&nbsp; I should start by saying that you can paint on the
design area by using the left or right button of the mouse
(assigning a different color to each, if you wish), either
single-clicking to paint one ring at a time or using click-and-drag
for a more continuous application of color.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To assign a color to a mouse button, just
click using the appropriate button on a color patch in the
palette.&nbsp; You’ll notice that the image at the top of the
palette window changes when you do this; this is your reminder of
which color you have assigned to each button:&nbsp; the ring on the
left shows the color assigned to the left button, the ring on the
right shows the color assigned to the right button.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You <i><u>un</u></i>-paint by holding down the
Alt key on your keyboard, then using either button of the mouse to
click (or click and drag) in the design area.&nbsp; If your mouse
has a functional middle button, you can also use that to
un-paint.&nbsp; Un-painting assigns the <i>transparent color</i> to
the ring you clicked on.&nbsp; Transparent rings are not considered
part of your finished design and are not counted by the color
counter (more on that later).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, you can’t paint ring colors on the
background or outlines, only on the rings.&nbsp; How do you know
you’ve got the mouse pointed to a ring?&nbsp; Either you zoom in
enough that you can’t possibly miss your intended ring (a good idea
anyway) or you can watch the indicator in the lower left of the
main window.&nbsp; When you are over a ring, this area will show
the unit column number, unit row number, and the number of the ring
within its unit (depending on the weave, a single chainmaille unit
can be composed of anywhere from 1 to 14 rings; the last number
tells you which ring of the unit you are pointed at).&nbsp; The
numbers are followed by the color name from the palette, if
any.</p>
<p class="MsoCaption"><img width="682" height="384" id="Picture 47"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image023.jpg"
alt="image" name="Picture 47"><br>
You probably don’t have to zoom in this much to color the ring you
want (but you can).<br>
As shown in the lower left corner, the central ring is in column 3
of row 23 and is the 2<sup>nd</sup> ring of its chainmaille
unit.&nbsp; Its palette color is red.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949760">Saving Your Design</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">When you’ve painted a bit, it’s time to save
what you have done so far.&nbsp; From the menu of the main window,
Select File &gt; Save Design As.&nbsp; This brings up a standard
save-as window with the file name conveniently defaulted to your
design name.&nbsp; Click the Save button to complete the
action.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949761">…And You Are On Your Way</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">That’s all you really <i>need</i> to know to
use the program to design your inlay projects, so go ahead and play
some more if you wish, but I am naturally anxious to share the full
extent of my cleverness with you, so when you are feeling indulgent
(or even mildly curious) I encourage you to read further.</p>
