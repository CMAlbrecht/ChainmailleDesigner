<h1><a name="_Toc98949819">Replacing Colors in Your Design</a></h1>
<p class="MsoNormal">The color replacement window allows you to
quickly change all of the rings of a particular color in your
design to any other color.&nbsp; This provides a painless
alternative to having to individually re-paint all of the rings of
a particular color.&nbsp; There are several reasons why you might
wish to do this:</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Change of design; the customer decided they’d like red better than
pink.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Repurposed design; the customer said something like “I’d like one
just like the one I saw Jim wearing, but with silver in place of
black and with a lighter blue.” or “Could you do something like
that in my team’s colors?”</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Starting a design with a color assigned to every ring.&nbsp; By
default, rings in a new design are uncolored, but if the inlay will
be on a background of bright aluminum rings (for example) it is
straightforward to start out a design by setting the color of all
of the uncolored rings to that of bright aluminum.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Change of materials; a design originally made for anodized aluminum
colors can be given the closest equivalent colors in titanium or
niobium.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Supplier change; the colors of the original design are no longer
available, but the design can be changed to use the colors from the
supplier’s most recent palette.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpMiddle" style='text-indent:-.25in'>
<span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style=
'font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span>
Upgrade of an old IGP design; each of the standard windows colors
in the design can easily be replaced by more accurate ring colors
from a defined palette.</p>
<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style='text-indent:-.25in'>

Fixing rings that were accidentally painted using colors from the
wrong palette section.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949820">Replace Colors in Design Window</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To perform color replacement in your design,
you’ll first need a design (although it could be a new design) and
you’ll also want a palette open.&nbsp; To begin, select Colors
-&gt; Replace in Design from the main menu.&nbsp; You’ll be
presented with the Replace Colors in Design window.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Besides the usual OK and Cancel buttons, this
window has four areas.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the upper left is the Color Replacements
area.&nbsp; The left side of this area shows all of the colors in
the design, while the right side of this area (once we start
working) will show all of the color replacements as we plan
them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The upper middle area shows the colors of one
section of the current palette.&nbsp; Replacement colors can be
chosen either from these color patches, or you can use the Other
Color button to choose any non-palette color.&nbsp; (The Other
Color button gets you to the Choose a Color window, described below
under <b><i>Defining Palettes, Choose a Color</i></b>.)&nbsp; To
change which palette section is displayed, choose a different
palette section name from the pull-down list box just above the
first palette color patch.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The third area, along the bottom, is the
preview area.&nbsp; As color replacements are defined, this area
shows what your design would look like with the changes.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fourth area, which is only visible if the
chainmaille weave used by the design has more than one ring size,
allows the color replacement to be restricted to rings of a certain
size.&nbsp; So, for example, I could start with a brand new
Dragonscale design and specify that all of the uncolored rings
<b><i>that are also small</i></b> should be colored as EPDM
black.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For this example, though, let’s start with the
fire bracelet we’ve previously seen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img width="624" height="491" id="Picture 26"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image066.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 26"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are a couple of things to notice
here.&nbsp; First, there are only four colors, and two of them
aren’t from the standard palette (the ones in the blank section,
with numbers instead of names).&nbsp; Second, remember that I said
that I use rubber rings for the small rings in these designs?&nbsp;
And yet, the red rings are colored with the anodized aluminum red,
not the EPDM red.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So first I’ll fix these issues to correct the
colors of the current design, then I’ll come back to make more
substantive changes toward a new design.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949821">Defining a Color Replacement</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">To define a color replacement, first click on
a color that is to be replaced (either the color patch or the color
name, either is fine) in the Color Replacements section.&nbsp; When
you do this, the color name will be highlighted to help you
remember which color you are working on.&nbsp; Next, click on the
color in the Color Selection section that you want to replace it
with (or use the Other Color button).&nbsp; When you select a
replacement color, the color you picked appears in the right-hand
column of the Color Replacement section, opposite the color you’re
replacing.&nbsp; You can also observe the effect of the color
replacement in the preview area.&nbsp; While a color is selected to
be replaced, you can click on any number of replacement colors in
succession to try out different substitutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To define a replacement for a different color,
select that color in the Color Replacements section, and proceed as
before.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For example, I’m going to switch to the rubber
colors palette (using the drop-down list), then define color
replacements for the yellow, orange, and red rings from that
palette.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img width="624" height="429" id="Picture 41"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image067.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 41"></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949822">Effecting the Replacement</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">As you can see in the preview, the colors are
subtly different.&nbsp; To effect the changes, click on the OK
button and the colors of the design will be changed.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc98949823">A More Dramatic Change</a></h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, I’m going to go for a more dramatic
change, changing the tone of the entire piece to make it more
earthy.&nbsp; I’ll replace all of the (newly corrected) rubber
colors with other colors from the rubber palette and change the
aluminum rings from black ice to bronze.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img width="624" height="491" id="Picture 68"
src="Chainmaille%20Designer%20Users%20Manual_files/image068.png"
alt="image" name="Picture 68"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Voila!&nbsp; What looks like a very different
piece is just the result of simple color substitutions.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You may wish to keep in mind that the color
replacement operation can be undone if you do not like the
results.</p>
