[assembly: AssemblyDescription("Chainmaille Designer started as a C# .NET 4.5 reimplementation of Zlosk's famous Irregular Grid Painter.  Along the way, we've added a few critical features:  the ability to print the rendered image from the program (instead of exporting the rendered image and using some other application to print it), the ability to zoom (critical, now that modern monitors have sufficiently high resolution that the rings shown by IGP are hard to click on), and the ability to save and reload color palettes (this means you can define the colors from, say, Ring Lord's anodized aluminum line once instead of every time you start the program).")]
