# Contributing to the Chainmaille Designer Project

Thank you for considering contributing to the Chainmaille Designer project.

The three principal areas for contributing to the project are issue reports, pull requests, and documentation.  In addition, if there is a weave or palette that you think other chainmaillers could benefit from, you are welcome to contribute a new definition file to the project.

## Issue Reports

When you create an issue report, please take the time to describe the issue.  If the issue was a problem with the software, please also describe the circumstances in which you observed it as clearly and precisely as possible.  Please also attach your design file.  If you were using your own palette or weave file, please attach those as well.

If instead you wish to propose an enhancement, please describe the enhancement and how you envision it fitting in to the design workflow as thoroughly as you can.

For documentation issues, please describe the error or supplemental material that you would like to see added.

## Pull Requests

If you are a programmer and wish to contribute a fix or enhancement, thank you!  If you have a fix or enhancement addressing an issue not already described, please take the time to first create an issue report for the issue.  In any case, please reference the issue in the pull request and say something useful about the root cause of the issue and in what manner your pull request will either fix the issue or provide the additional desired functionality.

If you are new to the project, please take some time to understand the fundamental concepts of the Designer and map out where they are embodied in the code.  There is a good introduction to the concepts in the second section of the Chainmaille Designer manual.

## Documentation Changes

Changes to the documentation are a bit problematic at the moment, since the bulk of the documentation is in the form of Word documents, which are not particularly amenable to pull request reviews.  For now, we recommend creating an issue report either describing the error to be corrected or the supplemental material that you would like to see added.  Particularly for enhancements, if you have a Word or RTF file of material that you would like to propose for inclusion please attach it to the issue report.

## New Weave or Palette files

For new weave or palette files, please submit a pull request adding the files to the appropriate directory of the project. In this case, the pull request description doesn't have to be anything elaborate; something like "Adding 'loopy-do' weave" is probably sufficient.  For the format to use when defining weaves or palettes, please refer to the sections at the end of the manual.

Alternatively, if you are not familiar with pull requests, you may instead create an issue report and attach your definition file to the issue report.
